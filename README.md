# ECE 6960: Sustainable Computing (Spring 2025)

## Description

Are you ready to dive into the environmental footprint of AI and the digital
world? In this graduate-level course, you’ll explore the entire lifecycle of
computing platforms—from the raw materials mined to power your devices, all the
way to their end-of-life disposal. This course goes beyond theory, offering a
comprehensive look at how the technology we rely on every day impacts the
planet.

We’ll investigate key topics like the carbon footprint of computing,
energy-efficient computer architectures, renewable-energy-powered data centers,
and the growing challenges of e-waste and resource depletion. You’ll also
explore innovative solutions in areas like AI-powered sustainability,
intermittent computing, and cutting-edge technologies that aim to reduce our
digital carbon footprint.

Through case studies, hands-on projects, and in-depth analysis of scholarly
articles, you'll learn to evaluate and measure the environmental impact of
computing platforms—focusing on carbon emissions, water usage, e-waste, and
material sustainability. By the end of the course, you’ll have a deeper,
holistic understanding of how technology can evolve to minimize its
environmental footprint and even help tackle global sustainability challenges.

Join us to become a leader in the green computing revolution, and help shape
the future of sustainable tech!
